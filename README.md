# ROS-Enabled Recycling Bin Sorting System

## Overview
The ROS-Enabled Recycling Bin Sorting System project aims to optimize recycling processes by integrating ROS (Robot Operating System). Through this integration, we seek to develop a sophisticated system capable of efficiently sorting recyclable materials using sensors, image processing, and robotic control.

## Description
This project involves rewriting existing Python scripts from a senior capstone project into ROS-enabled modules. These modules will form the backbone of a recycling bin sorting system, facilitating seamless communication between sensors, image processing algorithms, and robotic actuators. Leveraging ROS ensures scalability and interoperability for future enhancements and integration with other ROS packages.

## Functionality
- **Sensor Data Acquisition:** ROS nodes will interface with sensors such as cameras, motion sensors, and break beam sensors to acquire raw data from the recycling bin.
- **Image Processing:** A dedicated ROS node will handle image processing tasks to classify recyclable materials based on the acquired sensor data.
- **Servo Control:** Another ROS node will control the servo mechanism responsible for sorting items into respective bins based on classification results.
- **Integration with ROS Ecosystem:** All ROS nodes will integrate with existing and future ROS packages, ensuring broader functionality and interoperability within the ROS ecosystem.

## Team Members and Responsibilities
- **Individual Project:** The proposer leads the project, responsible for rewriting Python scripts into ROS-enabled modules, system integration, testing, documentation, and project management.

## Grading Rubric
- **ROS Nodes without functionality:** 30 points
- **Sensor Data Processing:** 10 points
- **Servo Control:** 10 points
- **Documentation and Code Quality:** 10 points

## Conclusion
The ROS-Enabled Recycling Bin Sorting System offers an exciting opportunity to optimize recycling processes through ROS integration. By enhancing functionality and scalability, we aim to create a more efficient and sustainable solution for waste management. Should this proposal not align with project requirements, exploring alternative options to further develop ROS skills remains viable.
